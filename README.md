# Anime-image-generator-using-DCGAN

Developed a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to create realistic anime character images. This project involved designing and training a DCGAN model to generate high-quality anime faces, demonstrating advanced AI techniques and creative applications in image generation.

Key Features:
Generative Model: Implemented a DCGAN architecture to generate diverse and realistic anime faces.
Training Process: Utilized a large dataset of anime images to train the model, optimizing it for high-quality output.
Results: Produced high-resolution anime characters with variations in features and styles.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Kaggle notebook
